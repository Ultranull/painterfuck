hey,
 do you like the esoteric programming language brainfuck?
 do you enjoy painting with difficult tools?
then I have a tool for you:
 painterfuck!

enjoy the loving caress of brainfuck while your program draws a pretty picture.
with 12 simple instructions!

r,g,b   : opens a color for editing its value (when opening one, you close the others)
+,-     : increments or decrements the value of the last opened color
^,v,<,> : moves the pointer in the direction being pointed
[,]     : loop open and close (loop ends when the last opened color value is zero)

after typing a program click run to see your masterpiece
and if you dont like it click reset to make it go away
save and load files containing painterfuck instructions from files on your computer

have fun!
